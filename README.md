ArchRC
========
ArchRC is a set of scripts for Arch Linux that installs OpenRC as the default init system and configures the system services to work well with it out of the box. ArchRC's main goal is to provide a solution for Arch users unhappy with Arch's switch to systemd or UNIX users looking to migrate to a traditional UNIX like Linux distribution.
